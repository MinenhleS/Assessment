- I created the python script which scraping, iterate hitting the website
- Made sure that enviroment aligned to what is there on the docker file (imported os for the viriables)
- Build an image (docker build . )
- Checked the image for image id so that i can use it to run docker (docker image ls)
- Then run docker (docker run <image id>)
- Finally i created a repo, add and commit my changes then push them.
